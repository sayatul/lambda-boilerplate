#### Install any Python binary dependency in AWS lambda

In this example, we have the following source directory structure:

```
├── Dockerfile
├── requirements.txt
├── src
│   ├── test.py
```

To build your zip file, just type:
```
docker build -t my-lambda .
```

Getting the zip file out, takes a little bit of Docker foo:
```
ID=$(docker create my-lambda /bin/true)		# create a container from the image
docker cp $ID:/ .				# copy the file from the /
```
